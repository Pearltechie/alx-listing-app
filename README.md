## STEP 11: Add Placeholder Assets

Create some placeholder images in your `public/assets/` folder. You can:

1. Download some property images from free stock photo sites
2. Save them as:
   - `cabin.jpg`
   - `apartment.jpg`
   - `placeholder.jpg` (fallback image)

Or create simple placeholder files for now and replace them later.

## STEP 12: Test Your Application

1. Make sure your development server is running:
```bash
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
You should see:

A header with "ALX Listing App"
A hero section with a gradient background
Property cards displaying your sample data
Working buttons with hover effects
